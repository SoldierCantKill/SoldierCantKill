# Introduction

Hello and thank you to anyone who is reading this.
My name is Cam'ron Hill. I am 18 years old.
I started programming a year ago in Unreal Engine and ever since then I have enjoyed working in programming.
My goal is that in the future I will be able to release my own game for a profit with the resources gained from working freelance & programming jobs.

# Experience
C++ - Alot of my C++ experiences comes directly from Unreal Engine. So I am used to using the Unreal Engine framework codebase.
C# - Not alot, Dived into Unity in the past for a short time.
Java - I learned a bit of the general frameworks that people use, I've only used it for an AP class and as such I didn't learn as much as I could have alone.
GDScript - All of this experience of course, comes directly from Godot.

# Projects

## Undertale Engine

This game was made in Godot 4.1 as an easy setup for anyone that was looking to create Undertale fangames.
